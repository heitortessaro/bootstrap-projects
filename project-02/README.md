The main objective of this project is to train the use of Bootstrap Library. The guide to setting up this project is available through this [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sosXZsdy-s&t=2028s).

The project built a web page using just Bootstrap Library. Bootstrap Library makes the production process easier and faster. However, the flexibility is limited. Thus, to achieve a more personalized solution, pure CSS is necessary.
